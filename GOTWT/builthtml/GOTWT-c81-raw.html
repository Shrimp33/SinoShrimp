<div id="content0" class="contentline">Chapter 81: Recovery of the World Tree</div>
<div id="content1" class="contentline">[Divine Power 101/500]</div>
<div id="content2" class="contentline">One hundred divine power was the cusp of finally escaping this dying state.</div>
<div id="content3" class="contentline">When divine power broke through this threshold, Eve instinctively knew He could revive the dying World Tree!</div>
<div id="content4" class="contentline">The dying world tree is unable to feast on the ambient mana, but once revived, this innate ability will be unlocked.</div>
<div id="content5" class="contentline">Eve had been waiting for this moment for too long.</div>
<div id="content6" class="contentline">Immediately, He started concentrating on His revival process.</div>
<div id="content7" class="contentline">By His command, one hundred divine power rapidly fled and was consumed. In response, His divine realm began radiating a brilliant green hue. The brilliance blossomed throughout the expanse of His realm and beyond, reaching and breaking through the spiritual realm and reaching to the physical body of the World Tree.</div>
<div id="content8" class="contentline">The divine power poured out and enveloped the branches of the world tree….</div>
<div id="content9" class="contentline">Divine power split in two strands; one wandered upwards, traveling from the thick trunk and coiling alongside branches, reaching to the crown of the canopy; another meandered downwards, following the roots to the extremities, reaching to the uttermost depths extending to thin and withered root fibers.</div>
<div id="content10" class="contentline">Consequently, a primal wave of satisfying pleasure washed over Eve, who felt a strange tingling sensation building up over His form.</div>
<div id="content11" class="contentline">Finally, as the crescendo of divine power reached a peak, as if a seal was pierced, the breath of life gushed out and gathered from the World Tree.</div>
<div id="content12" class="contentline">In an instant, an aura spread throughout the safety zone, altering the spirits of everyone within.</div>
<div id="content13" class="contentline">And then, the ground started to shake, as if something was stirring underneath.</div>
<div id="content14" class="contentline">The roots of the World Tree had begun to rejuvenate, with the original frail and withering fibers, growing and tunneling downwards.</div>
<div id="content15" class="contentline">Above ground, the terrain shifted and shook, like an earthquake.</div>
<div id="content16" class="contentline">"What's Happening?"</div>
<div id="content17" class="contentline">"Earth… Earthquake?"</div>
<div id="content18" class="contentline">Startled by the shaking of the terrain, the players were anxious.</div>
<div id="content19" class="contentline">A player haphazardly glanced back in the direction of the World Tree.</div>
<div id="content20" class="contentline">Speechless, His eyes were wide with disbelief, which quickly transformed into excitement and shock.</div>
<div id="content21" class="contentline">"Look! Look at the World Tree! The World Tree!"</div>
<div id="content22" class="contentline">Hearing him, the other players also turned back.</div>
<div id="content23" class="contentline">Immediately, their mouths were agape with shock, too.</div>
<div id="content24" class="contentline">The World Tree changed.</div>
<div id="content25" class="contentline">The goddess had just recovered, and the condition of the World Tree was near death.</div>
<div id="content26" class="contentline">Although the player had seen the full glory of the World Tree in the game trailer, in-game, the tree had already withered.</div>
<div id="content27" class="contentline">After the thousand-year war of the gods, the World Tree was left with bare branches and withering leaves.</div>
<div id="content28" class="contentline">Furthermore, the withered tree has significantly shrunk physically.</div>
<div id="content29" class="contentline">The remaining green clinging to the branches was sparse and rare.</div>
<div id="content30" class="contentline">But now, the world tree had changed.</div>
<div id="content31" class="contentline">The World Tree is now rejuvenated and full of life.</div>
<div id="content32" class="contentline">As far as the eye could see, the magnificent trunk gave off a noble aura of the essence of life and nature.</div>
<div id="content33" class="contentline">And at the top of the branches, countless leaf buds were drawn out. Then, they began to sprout and spread their leaves at a speed visible to the naked eye ….</div>
<div id="content34" class="contentline">In no time, the original bare and empty branches were covered in uncountable quantities of tender leaves.</div>
<div id="content35" class="contentline">In spite of its sparse foliage, the World Tree now looked much more lively and cheerful than it did in its dilapidated state, as if it were welcoming the arrival of spring.</div>
<div id="content36" class="contentline">As the World Tree burgeoned, waves of a primordial power spread across the ground, carrying with it the power of law.</div>
<div id="content37" class="contentline">All the players in the vicinity who had passed the wave felt as if a current of ice water had just engulfed them from head to toe. There was a sense of awe coming spiritually into the soul.</div>
<div id="content38" class="contentline">This is the natural response to the spiritual oppression of higher beings onto mortal lifeforms.</div>
<div id="content39" class="contentline">Following the burgeoning World Tree, a magnificent green vortex of light stretches out from the trunk as its center.</div>
<div id="content40" class="contentline">The players that had come into contact with the brilliant light felt a physical change in themselves.</div>
<div id="content41" class="contentline">Those who had checked their stats found that they had varying growths in experience and power.</div>
<div id="content42" class="contentline">Druid classes, though, were in a league of their own when compared to buffs from before.</div>
<div id="content43" class="contentline">Meanwhile, the brilliant vortex of light continued to propagate and prompted all plants in the forest to thrive at a rapid rate, especially the ones in the safe zone and with the World Tree in the center.</div>
<div id="content44" class="contentline">As if possessed, the shrubs and vegetation began to spontaneously sprout and burgeon with fanatical motions as their palms waved and grew to the visible eye.</div>
<div id="content45" class="contentline">Even those trees that had been cut down by the players for wood had sprouted anew into hearty saplings.</div>
<div id="content46" class="contentline">Not just undergoing a rebirth, these saplings had grown ten meters in under a minute.</div>
<div id="content47" class="contentline">As far as the eye could see, the ground has been fully covered in green once again.</div>
<div id="content48" class="contentline">Even the wooden houses built by the players began to grow leaves.</div>
<div id="content49" class="contentline">Even more magically, they began to bud flowers and bear fruit.</div>
<div id="content50" class="contentline">Nature had healed in a way that, as if shepherded by a will.</div>
<div id="content51" class="contentline">Neither the public works nor the houses of the player had been damaged by nature; the will of nature had taken them into consideration and had added to them in a benign way.</div>
<div id="content52" class="contentline">At once, the village had been transformed into a sea of flowers and thriving greenery.</div>
<div id="content53" class="contentline">Countless flower pedals flew in the air, creating an orchestra of a thousand colors in the sky.</div>
<div id="content54" class="contentline">The players were all stunned in surprise.</div>
<div id="content55" class="contentline">"My house is alive now, wow!"</div>
<div id="content56" class="contentline">"Wow, my house is a tree house now."</div>
<div id="content57" class="contentline">"It looks so pretty!"</div>
<div id="content58" class="contentline">"Isn't this too extravagant? Has the World Tree fully recovered?"</div>
<div id="content59" class="contentline">There were even players who casually picked the fruit off of people's houses and took a bite.</div>
<div id="content60" class="contentline">"Sweet."</div>
<div id="content61" class="contentline">The forest and shrubbery in a 30-kilometer radius were rapidly revitalized and faced the World Tree.</div>
<div id="content62" class="contentline">They bent down their branches and stems as if they were bowing to their general.</div>
<div id="content63" class="contentline">The players were shocked by this act of nature "worshiping".</div>
<div id="content64" class="contentline">All things were in adoration.</div>
<div id="content65" class="contentline">The awe it brings to the senses and in the flesh is indescribable!</div>
<div id="content66" class="contentline">Being the cause and center of all this development, Eve felt immense changes in himself comparable to heaven and earth.</div>
<div id="content67" class="contentline">As soon as leaves sprouted and reached for the skies, His grip on the world began to strengthen by leaps and bounds. His zone of control of 10 kilometers was enlarged to 30 kilometers!</div>
<div id="content68" class="contentline">After the resurgence of the World Tree, the divine power spent on recovery started to accumulate rapidly, and Eve's divine power began to recover rapidly.</div>
<div id="content69" class="contentline">Hitting 90 points of divine power, the rally of divine power slowed.</div>
<div id="content70" class="contentline">Eve checked her status once again.</div>
<div id="content71" class="contentline">[Name: Eve Euktrahill]</div>

<div id="content79" class="contentline">"Draw?"</div>
<div id="content80" class="contentline">Seeing the new ability, Eve's heart was trembling in excitement.</div>
