Which form did the previous World Tree reach?”</div><div id="content13" class="contentline">Eve can't help but wonder...</div><div id="content14" class="contentline">If the primary form was already approaching the power of a weak Ancient God, then what were the subsequent forms like?</div><div id="content15" class="contentline">Medium divine power?</div><div id="content16" class="contentline">Strong divine power?</div><div id="content17" class="contentline">Or— something more?</div><div id="content18" class="contentline">Suddenly, Eve found ~Himself humbled.</div><div id="content19" class="contentline">Then, ~He focused on the targets of Draw—.</div><div id="content20" class="contentline">"The Void origin, dimensional planes, life itself..."</div><div id="content21" class="contentline">The world of Cygnus is inherently different from the Milky Way.</div><div id="content22" class="contentline">Instead, they could be categorized as two completely separate universes.</div><div id="content23" class="contentline">The Milky Way is dotted with countless constellations full of planets and stars. Galaxies such as the Milky Way make up the celestial universe.</div><div id="content24" class="contentline">In contrast, the world of Cygnus is completely different.</div><div id="content25" class="contentline">Cygnus is of a web of many planar worlds.</div><div id="content26" class="contentline">The planar universe consists of many planes of varying sizes and environmental conditions, each world is sealed in a bubble-like barrier, and the web is suspended in an imperceptible aether.</div><div id="content27" class="contentline">In Cygnus, this primal aether is coined as the Void.</div><div id="content28" class="contentline">Cygnus— the world of Eve’s arrival, is the most ancient in this web and accommodates a high dimensional level.</div><div id="content29" class="contentline">Life springs easily from the main plane, which contains the most favorable laws of the web.</div><div id="content30" class="contentline">It’s said that the Cygnus plane was the origin of all life in the planar universe.</div><div id="content31" class="contentline">Contemplating the origin of the Cygnus universe got Eve thinking about the related powers of Draw, and a thought struck:</div><div id="content32" class="contentline">“The reason the former World Tree was targeted… It couldn't have been because of the power of Draw, right?”</div><div id="content33" class="contentline">Targeting the Void origin is mundane, yet on the other hand, an ability that can directly target the origin of planes themselves can pose a serious threat.</div><div id="content34" class="contentline">Alas, the origin of a plane sustains its very essence, so drawing on this critical resource can cause the plane to lower in dimensional level and even collapse.</div><div id="content35" class="contentline">As for drawing from the essence of life….</div><div id="content36" class="contentline">The gods of old… especially the gods of faith — worship and faith are the lifeblood of their godhead — an ability that could sap this would essentially hold them hostage.</div><div id="content37" class="contentline">If the predecessor had really been pursuing this form of absolute control over the origin of the plane, then it wouldn’t be unrealistic for the gods to organize and besiege ~Him in the heavenly war a thousand-years prior.</div><div id="content38" class="contentline">Though, if that were true, then the World Tree would have likely been framed as an evil god — yet, Eve has never heard of this slander.</div><div id="content39" class="contentline">Although the World Tree was already withered and ruined, judging by the reaction of the Orcs, the beings of the world still held reverence and respect for the ancient god.</div><div id="content40" class="contentline">Moreover, the elves — a race born from the World Tree — are a symbol of peace, grace, and nobility.</div><div id="content41" class="contentline">“Truly, the mystery of the heavenly war is shrouded in darkness."</div><div id="content42" class="contentline">Eve sighs.</div><div id="content43" class="contentline">Musing to a dead end, ~He decided to try to Draw.</div><div id="content44" class="contentline">After calming down and consulting intuition, Eve activated the ability.</div><div id="content45" class="contentline">As soon as Draw was activated, Eve’s field of vision shifted.</div><div id="content46" class="contentline">~He found that ~His senses had begun expanding until ~He had broken beyond the barrier of the Cygnus plane and could “see” the Void.</div><div id="content47" class="contentline">Moreover, ~He could even “see” the imperceptible aether that made up the Void.</div><div id="content48" class="contentline">Small clouds of light carried the energy of the Void— as they swirled around throughout the empty Void— energy was eaten continuously by the Cygnus plane— simultaneously, new clouds of light were birthed from the Void in an equilibrium.</div><div id="content49" class="contentline">"Is this the ~origin power of the Void?"</div><div id="content50" class="contentline">Eve was awed as Draw underwent.</div><div id="content51" class="contentline">In ~His state of fascination, countless more clouds of energy sped due course for the Cygnus plane.</div><div id="content52" class="contentline">Vast quantities of light rushed through the Cygnus plane— portions were absorbed by the plane itself— whilst other slices passed the barrier and rushed towards Eve’s figure.</div><div id="content53" class="contentline">As Void energy surged— Eve felt a strange tingling sensation and divine power aggrandized.</div><div id="content54" class="contentline">One point… two points… three points…</div><div id="content55" class="contentline">The surge only slowed down gradually after accumulating 30 points.</div><div id="content56" class="contentline">The evanescent moment concluded with the downturn of incoming light — the flow of divine power had stabilized.</div><div id="content57" class="contentline">Greedily, Eve peered back into the Void and found that the surrounding aether had all been consumed— distant aether had not yet diffused to fill the absence.</div><div id="content58" class="contentline">~He estimated on the current rate of diffusion and adsorption, ~He could be guaranteed one point of divine power around every ten days.</div><div id="content59" class="contentline">“What a powerful ability! At this rate, even if I do nothing, I’ll still be able to reach weak divine power!”</div><div id="content60" class="contentline">Eve was delighted.</div><div id="content61" class="contentline">Emerging from the deathly state, ~His divine power cap had reached 3000.</div><div id="content62" class="contentline">At 3000 points of divine power, the cap of weak divine power is hit— beyond— one has to advance ~His godhead or laws.</div><div id="content63" class="contentline">However, in Eve’s case, the godhead is already advanced— as ~He gains divine power, ~He can simply return to the prior level of the predecessor.</div><div id="content64" class="contentline">In other words, once he reaches 3000 points of divine power, he will be able to advance to weak divine power immediately.</div><div id="content65" class="contentline">This is why Uriel was so rash in getting the godhead of nature and life.</div><div id="content66" class="contentline">It is divine power that determines where the gods rank, without which their power is limited by capacity.</div><div id="content67" class="contentline">“Draw… indeed, a very strong ability!”</div><div id="content68" class="contentline">Eve was over-satisfied.</div><div id="content69" class="contentline">While admiring ~His newfound ability, the entire plane of Cygnus shook with changes….</div><div id="content70" class="contentline">Eve sensed the level of magical power in the Cygnus realm was rising almost at a rate visible to the naked eye, and in the blink of an eye, it was a whole percent higher than before!</div>
